[![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/mattglover/MoreColors_Demo/master/screenshot.png)]

## History

Many moons ago, Jeff Lamarche wrote a blog post about a category he developed for colors used in his application 
.. I believe his initial plan was to keep adding colors as he needed them but then he decided to source the colors
and descriptions from the wiki page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors

For a fuller description of this extremely useful category please visit http://iphonedevelopment.blogspot.co.uk/2008/11/more-colors-more-compact.html 
for more details.

## Further development

If anyone wishes to write a script to update the Category with all the latest colors from Wikipedia, please be my guest.

## Credit

Credit obviously goes to Jeff Lamarche.
All I've done is wrap it into a simple app to help decide what the colors look like on device.
